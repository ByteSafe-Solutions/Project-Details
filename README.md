**Client:** Unreal Motion Pictures (Fictional Company)

**Business Objective:** To seamlessly transition from a loosely managed IT environment to a well-organized and secure IT infrastructure that supports the company's expansion plans.

## Scenario

### A small CGI company was founded by two high-school friends needs to grow beyond the living room.
   These friends started out making videos on their phones. Now they employ a few more artists and a business manager. The two founders live together and their home has served as a defacto office, but the other employees usually work from home.

   - With the money from recent advertising jobs, they want to hire more artists and move into a real office where they will have the space to expand.

   - They want to move away from the BYOD method and start providing computers owned and managed by the company.

   - The artists are proficient and responsible Windows and Mac users, but lack any IT skills.
     - Artists work mostly on powerful Mac or Windows workstations, though they also have laptops used for lighter work and when filming.

   - Managing the many large video and graphics files has been a pain-point. With artists working from home, the stop-gap solution has been a poorly organized shelf of external and internal hard-drives used to move data to and from the founders' home.
     - They would like some kind of central data storage solution on site at their office.
     - They may want to make this central data storage solution accessible remotely in the future, but that is not a current need.

Your Managed Service Provider (MSP) team's mission is to present a comprehensive plan that demonstrates how you will help Unreal Motion Pictures achieve these objectives. By showcasing your technical expertise, attention to detail, and commitment to their success, you aim to convince them that you are the ideal partner to guide them through this transformative IT journey.

Your job is to prepare a technical demonstration of how you will meet the given requirements to help the client achieve its business objective.
